# NASA Rovers Streamer App with SwiftUI

A project that gets photos taken by rovers
 of NASA sent (Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit)
 and shows them in the corresponded tabs of each
 rovers.

 The app is built using the new technology that served

 its built-in MVVM Architecture. Because of its nature,
 it is not necessary to build architecture from scratch.
 I mainly used a repository class to fetch the 
 data from the API services.
